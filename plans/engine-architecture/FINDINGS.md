# Findings log

**What the build taught.** Read the rows touching the task you pick up.

**Newest first. Forty words a row, counted.** The long version is in the commit message.

**What goes here:** what the next session would otherwise rediscover · what you noticed and left
alone under the scope rule (an `owns` path that fits another chapter better, DESIGN §2.7) ·
answers from the user, dated.

**Whoever appends, compacts** (over 60 rows or 15 KB). Never drop a ✅ row or its date.

| Date | | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-23 | 📌 | T04: `Pacing` and `PassClock` (`engine/crates/sf-core/src/game.rs`, owned by game-flow) are the beam mechanism's interface; `cpu-time-and-beam` describes them without owning them. Four separate beam models exist: level `Clock`, front `Cx`, `slot/draw.rs`, story `sim.rs`. For T18. |
| 2026-10-23 | 📌 | T04: T213 is ✅ in `plans/rust-engine/PROGRESS.md`, yet the project `CLAUDE.md` and the T04 task doc call it open. The chapter states it as ✅ and names the story `sfx_play` remainder. |
| 2026-10-23 | 📌 | T02 review: `layout.rs`'s `Level1Vector` doc names only `enemies::w3::swing` as writing `$64`; `enemies::w2::mace` does the same through a null link slot. Code comment, left alone. |
| 2026-10-23 | 📌 | T02: `mem.rs` is half copied-in data (`loaded_hunk0`, `boot_tables`, `tile_heights`, `Rom::new`) but owned by `memory-model`, which counts it as `data` 15. No check names the null-pointer reads at 0/4 or the `$64` write; T18 may weigh both. |
| 2026-10-23 | 📌 | T05: the keyboard poll is ported twice (`kbd_poll` in `level/clock.rs` and `front/vbl.rs`, state in `State::kbd_flag`/`kbd_acked` and `front::Keyboard`); a rewrite can merge them. No check moves the mouse (`JOY0DAT` always 0). |
| 2026-10-23 | 📌 | `tools/architecture.py totals` counts 111k code lines today (verification 47.8k, app 10.4k), against DESIGN §1's ~75k on `pir/rust-engine`. The T01 ownership table covered every tracked file; nothing was reassigned. |
| 2026-10-22 | 📌 | The stored `.pir/settings.json` test line runs only the Python suites (34 tests, ~36 s on a fresh worktree); the Rust suites are not in it. This plan changes no Rust, so the drift check joins the Python suites. |
| 2026-10-22 | 📌 | The Amiga imitation is woven through `sf-core`, not layered: byte-exact `State` at original addresses, `spend` cycle charging, cycle-run copper, and the story's own bus simulator (`front/story/sim.rs`, `cpu.rs`, `mem.rs`). Hence mechanism chapters. |
